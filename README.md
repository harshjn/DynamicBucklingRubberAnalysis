# Buckling Analysis via Images for Threads/rods/membranes

In this Image Processing project, I'm analysing images captured from a Phantom slow-motion camera, captured at intervals of 66 microseconds with MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox. These codes can be used to measure lengths with sub-pixel resolution. 
I am using these for Dynamic Buckling Analysis of experiments performed in Soft Matter Lab at TIFR.

We take an image that looks as below:
### Input
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/harshjn/DynamicBucklingRubberAnalysis.m/blob/master/image_fixed_width-2">  
</p>

### Output
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/harshjn/DynamicBucklingRubberAnalysis.m/blob/master/image_fixed_width">  
</p>

And we get detected points in blue and red as I've labeled on the above black and white image.
